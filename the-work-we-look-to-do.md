# The Work We Look To Do

Nobody and no thing is perfect. The work we do as people and as a company will sometimes include things that don't excite us, that seem mundane, or that we sense may never see the light of day. That's the reality we live in.

That said, we can do our utmost to look for and do meaningful work. Here is some guidance on how we qualify opportunities to bid on. This guidance goes to our moral position on work, as well as the commitment we make to ourselves and out clients:

__Does it align with our values?__ Does both the immediate work being done and the ripple effects as a result of it existing align with our core values? Will it help people, with maximum impact, at scale? Or is it supporting something we don't believe in?

__Do we have the capability to do this?__ What skills are required and who has those skills? Is it something shared by everyone or a specialisation only one of us can do? Does it require a highly experienced person or could a less experienced person deliver the desired outcome? Perhaps a mid-level does 80% of the work under the direction of an expert?

__If we won the work, do we have the capacity to deliver?__ If we know what the start and end dates are and the distribution of effort (even, front-loaded, oscillating, or slow ramp up), will we have the necessary people available? Might we want to bring contractors on?

__Does it align with our strategic objectives?__ Will delivering this work help build our reputation as a boutique design agency and give us relevant experience and case studies to go on to bigger and better things, or is it just to pay the bills? Could it dilute our brand and blunt our value proposition to the market?

__Do we have the time to win the work?__ Do we have the people available to put together a high-quality bid (for written responses) and have it reviewed and honed in time or might it be a rush job? Do we have time to plan our approach and build a relationship with the client, ask questions, do some research and ensure we hit the mark? How good does the bid have to be to give us a good chance of winning the work? How polished are the bids from our competitors likely to be?
