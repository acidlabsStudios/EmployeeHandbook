## Introduction
The first thing you should know is that, in the words of Maui, "you're welcome!", though not in the be thankful sense, rather in the sense that, you are welcome here.

We've created this handbook so that when a new person joins us, they don't need to figure things out for themselves. Large parts of it are inspired by [Basecamp's public employee handbook](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook). Hey, they did the work so companies like ours don't need to start from scratch.

Joining any new company is an exercise in navigating new ways; acidlabs Studios in particular is possibly more so, given how different some of our practices are. There’s as much to unlearn from your previous corporate existence as there is to learn. Before this handbook, navigating that path was almost entirely oral history.

So, this is where we’ll try to share what’s worth knowing about acidlabs Studios the company, our culture, our process, and our history. It’s a guide to understanding what people are talking about, whether it’s okay to take your holidays when you’ve only been with us for a month (yes), and hopefully everything in-between.

This handbook also helps clarify who we actually are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Writing down those beliefs into a handbook makes them real and, most importantly, editable and changeable. 

That acidlabs Studios is a living example of the way we help our clients is a guiding principle, but we can’t easily improve what we haven’t written down. Whatever version of this handbook you’re reading, you can be sure it’s not the last. Please help keep it up to date! And by up to date, we're not just talking about misspellings and team changes. It’s just as much “we say we’re about X, but what we’re really doing is Y”. So many of these employee handbook projects turn out to be ideal-case prescriptions rather than real-world descriptions. They cover all the ways people should act, not the ways they actually do. That’s bulldust (to use a very Australian phrase). Let’s not have a handbook like that. Let’s keep it honest and reflective of our own walking the talk.

If you’re reading this just after joining the company, it’s particularly on you, actually. It’s harder for us old hands to see the broken bits. Take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things. There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers.
