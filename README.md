# acidlabs Employee Handbook

Until 2016, there was no handbook. Just a bunch of ideas in several people's heads. When someone new came to work with us, it was confusing as they had to work things out on their own and absorb a culture and ways of working that are often unfamiliar if you've worked in a regular corporate job; even one in the design industry. Oral history is great, but it's for telling stories, not for onboarding new people.

This is our _living_ guide to working at acidlabs. In here, you'll find all sorts of things to guide the way we work, your careers, projects, perks and conditions, and so on. There's also a decent serving of our history.

This handbook also grants us an opportunity to identify who we are as a company. What do we stand for? How should we work? Writing these things down into this handbook makes them tangible and, most importantly, editable. Ensuring acidlabs iteself our best product is a guiding principle, but we can’t make better what we haven’t described. Whatever version of this  you’re reading, it’s definitely not the last. Please do help keep it up to date! If you have suggested changes, you can lodge them as Issues against a given document, or just make the change after you've talked it out with colleagues. At some point early in your time here, you'll be given write access to the repo so you can make your own changes.
