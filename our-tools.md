# Our tools

We have a number of tools that help us support, report, and operate the company. They are as follows:

__Google Suite__: Email, calendars, and documents of all sorts are managed through Google Suite. If you've used Gmail, you know how it works. Your GSuite identity should also work for single sign-on for most of our tool set.

You get a personal drive that you can sync to your desktop and devices if you install the relevant app. There's also a team drive where we store everything we might want collectively.

__Xero__: Company finances are managed with Xero. You'll have access for lodging expenses, checking payroll, and so on.

__Basecamp__: You're using it. It's our lifeblood.

__Harvest and Forecast__: Harvest and Forecast are used for time tracking and generating effort vs. estimate data. You'll enter your hours worked and on what here. Yes, we know time sheets are a PITA. But unless you're measuring, you can't control. That said, minute-level accuracy isn't what we're after. We want to know if you're working too much (and we underestimated what your project would take) or if we're extra-profitable.

__Highrise__: Still something of an experiment, we use Highrise for CRM. You'll have access so we can all see your emails and such related to a client (so, don't cc other people in the company because we all know email is rubbish).

__Proposify__: We use this proposal management tool to build out proposals for clients and to do some pipeline management that gets synced with Xero, Highrise and Harvest.

__Smaply__: For journey mapping, stakeholder mapping and personas.
