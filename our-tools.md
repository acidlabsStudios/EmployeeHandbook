# Our tools

We have a number of tools that help us support, report, and operate the company. They are as follows:

### Google Suite
Email, calendars, and documents of all sorts are managed through Google Suite. If you've used Gmail, you know how it works. Your GSuite identity should also work for single sign-on for most of our tool set.

You get a personal drive that you can sync to your desktop and devices if you install the relevant app. There's also a team drive where we store everything we might want collectively.

### Xero
Company finances are managed with Xero including invoicing, expenditure, projects, timesheets. You'll have access for lodging expenses, checking payroll, and so on.

### Basecamp
You'll use it every day. It's our lifeblood.

### Highrise
Still something of an experiment, we use Highrise for CRM. You'll have access so we can all see your emails and such related to a client (so, don't cc other people in the company because we all know email is rubbish).

### Proposify
We use this proposal management tool to build out proposals for clients and to do some pipeline management that gets synced with Xero and Highrise.
