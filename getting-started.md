# Getting started

## Expectations

Getting started at acidlabs can be a big cognitive load. There are a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, you're learning a new job and new coworkers, and you're likely doing all these things while working remotely. Your Basecamp buddy and your manager are all here to help. If you don't know what you're doing, please ask. There is no set time period for most onboarding stuff, but most people are up to speed in about 3 months.

## Your buddy

Usually when you start a new job in an office, it's clear [who does what](https://github.com/acidlabsdesign/EmployeeHandbook/blob/master/who-does-what.md). In a remote company, it's a little less clear. Even when you know who does what, it's still nice to have a work buddy to ping when you don't know where to turn. So we set up a Basecamp Buddy system. When you start, you'll be assigned a buddy. They'll introduce themselves, and they're totally willing to point you in the right direction when you need it. Of course, everyone is available to help, but it's nice to have a dedicated best work friend.

## Setting up

When people join acidlabs, they're expected to spend the first few days just hanging around getting the lay of the land. That doesn't mean you do nothing; there's plenty to do. What it does mean is that during your first week, we'll do our best not to saddle you with delivery responsibilities on any business-critical work.

We already think we like you and can work with you - that's why we hired you. But we don't know each other well yet, so taking this approach allows you to meet us, get a sense of how you might fit in, and gives you room to complete a few threshold tasks in a project we call __First Week__ that will do the necessary staff admin, give us a better sense of you, and let you figure out what you can manage and what you might need some mentoring and development on. Your buddy will guide you through this.
