# Who does what?

Figuring out who talk to about anything at work shouldn’t be a guessing game. Every single person who works at acidlabs Studios is approachable and friendly, and more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you're probably not the first, so speak up!

## Executive
Stephen Collins (also Steve or trib) is our Founder and runs our design practice. He’s responsible for setting the overall direction of the studio, and for closing with potential clients. Steve also spends a lot of time writing and speaking about what we’ve learned as a company. He dreamed up the idea of acidlabs Studios on holiday in 2006.

## Design
Nathanael Coyne is our Senior Designer on contract right now. Kara DeFrias will be our Principal Designer as soon as we can find her work to do.
