# Who does what?

Figuring out who talk to about anything at work shouldn’t be a guessing game. If you have a concern about something, it _should_ be pretty straightforward to figure out who to speak with. Every single person who works at acidlabs is approachable and friendly, and more than willing to point you in the right direction. If you have a question, you're probably not the first, so speak up!

At our current scale, we don't really have teams or groups, so the divisions below are kind of arbitrary.

### Executive

#### Director
__Stephen Collins__ (also Steve or trib) is the company founder and still works in our design practice. He’s responsible for setting the overall direction of the studio. Steve also spends a lot of time writing and speaking about what we’ve learned as about design, business, leadership and so on. He dreamed up the idea of acidlabs on holiday in 2006.

__Kara DeFrias__ is our mentor, guide, sounding board, and advisor. She's based in San Diego and is the go-to person for when you might have doubts about a decision you want to make. She's also an active designer, speaker, and all-around genius, One day, we'll find a way to bring her to Australia.

### Design
__Nathanael Coyne__ is our Senior Designer right now. He's an instinctive designer, coach for ways of working, and more. He was also the first hire at the company. __Linda Gehard__ is a Senior Designer based out of Sydney with a useful history working on mobile, FMCG and more.

### Business Development
Right now, the entire BD team is __Katrina Tidy__. If you talk to someone who might be a lead, or hear about something we should be doing, talk to her. She's also a first-class content strategist, project manager, and maker of things to happen.
