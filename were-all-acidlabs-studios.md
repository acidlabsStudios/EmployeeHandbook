# We're all acidlabs Studios

Everyone working at acidlabs Studios represents acidlabs Studios. When a client talks to Steve about a design problem, Steve is acidlabs Studios. When a different client reads a tweet by you that talks about accessible forms, you are acidlabs Studios. In those situations, all the other stuff we do to cultivate our best image is secondary. What’s right in front of someone in a time of need is what they’ll remember.

That’s what we mean when we say marketing is everyone’s responsibility, and that it pays to spend the time to recognize that. This means avoiding the bullshit of management-speak and bending policies to fit needs within reason, not just listening. It means taking the time to get the words right and consider how you’d feel if you were on the other side of the interaction.

It also means that you’re strongly encouraged to help share your thoughts, experiences, and learnings on [Lab Notes](https://notes.acidlabs.org/), our blog. Some (ideally more) of our clients come from word of mouth and much of that word comes from people in our audience. Your voice is part of us now. Tell us and our audience what you have to say!

This goes for tools and techniques as much as it goes for prose. acidlabs Studios not only tries to offer more informative lessons than our competition, but also share and collaborate better. Extracting the common lessons learned that others could use is satisfying, important work, and we should continue to do that.

It's worth saying that joining acidlabs Studios can be all-consuming. We've seen it happen. You enjoy being a part of acidlabs Studios, so you feel the need to contribute. The people who work here are some of the best and brightest in our industry, so the self-imposed burden to be fab is real. But here's the thing: stop it. Settle in. We're delighted you love this job because we all do, but at the end of the day it's just a job. 

Do your best work, collaborate with your team, write, read, learn, and then go home on time and turn off your computer and play with your dog, go for a walk, eat dinner with your kids, whatever. 

We'll all be better because we have real lives.
