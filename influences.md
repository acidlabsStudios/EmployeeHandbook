# What influenced us, or The big-assed culture, style, howto and practice reading list and other things

If you want to learn the acidlabs view of the world, it helps to know the influences that helped form it. acidlabs has been around since 2006. Most of that time it was a one-person show with Steve as the only employee. All that changed beginning 2013. Since the beginning there have been a number of key influencers and influences that have marked the company culture.

## Things to read
Below is a bunch of reading we consider influential on us and the culture we're trying to build at acidlabs. Feel free to read them at your leisure. We're putting it here in a document so they remains easy to find.

The list of influential books we like is collected at [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/3178326-stephen-collins?shelf=business-culture-reading-list), with regular additions of new stuff that may be interesting to you. We have access to many of these as physical books and are more than happy to loan them. Some Kindle books can also be loaned, but that's getting more difficult.

We're big fans of:
* [Flow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/117101.Flow) by Mihalyi Cziksenmihalyi as it illustrates why and how the ability to focus intensely on something is incredibly beneficial
* [Maverick](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32994.Maverick) by Ricardo Semler as it shows that the accepted way of doing business doesn't have to be what you accept
* [REWORK](https://37signals.com/rework) and [REMOTE](https://37signals.com/remote) by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. They're the founders of Basecamp (the company that makes this tool you're using right now) and we very much model acidlabs Studios on the Basecamp way. You should also read the original Basecamp manifesto [Getting Real](https://gettingreal.37signals.com/), which is available online free.
* [Cubicle Commando](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6997692-cubicle-commando) by Lisa Messenger and Zern Liew. It's a great look at (and beautifully designed, BTW) how to change organisations from within to drive innovation and creativity.

None of these are specifically about the technical doing or how-to of what we do at acidlabs Studios (be that design thinking, service, design, ux, cx, strategy, creativity, sketching, blahblahblah, etc.), though they might cover some of that; that's a whole different subject. You can find a lot of books on those subjects on Goodreads as well.

There are also a bunch of pieces on the web you might like to read or watch. This list is added to from time to time:

* [A picture of a better place](https://m.signalvnoise.com/a-picture-of-a-better-place-c3f39017ac35) - why a companyâ€™s vision really matters (and how to figure out yours)
