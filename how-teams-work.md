# How teams work

We're a little company, so these ideas are very malleable right now. As we grow, that will probably change. A lot. Whatever happens, we'll keep the core of what's written here.

## Heartbeats

It’s hard to keep up with what everyone is doing and what it means. If you just watch the stream of latest activity scrolling along in Basecamp it’s a waste of time and source of stress to even try. Instead, we have three chief mechanisms for keeping everyone in the loop about the work that’s going on.

First, there’s the daily question of [What did you work on today?](https://3.basecamp.com/3094635/buckets/2664071/questions/382188376) which supplies the nitty gritty details, but as a personal narrative. They’re a great conversation starter if you see someone working on something you either care about or want to learn more about. Put a little narrative effort in and please do use them as such!

Second, there’s the weekly question of [What will you be working on this week?](https://3.basecamp.com/3094635/buckets/2664071/questions/382188377) which answers the nitty gritty of your coming week at a slightly higher level. Well, at least the intentions of the week!

Third, and finally, there are [the team updates](https://3.basecamp.com/3094635/buckets/3601450/message_boards/503499872). They usually happen part way through project cycles, at the end of a cycle, or when something new is launched. This is where the big presentation of work is done, and the main way for you to keep in the loop with what the company is focused on at a high, digestible level.

## Pitching an idea

When you have an idea for something we should change or improve and the idea feels formed enough, it’s turned into a pitch. A pitch is a fully-formed definition of the problem as well as a proposed solution. We don’t pitch in person — we always write up pitches and post them to Basecamp for review.

Why don’t we pitch in person? For a few reasons:

__We feel it’s better to write something up completely. This forces the floor__ — the person who’s making the pitch can’t be interrupted. They are guaranteed to be able to present their story completely, exactly as they wanted.

Further, we believe __writing things out makes you consider them at a deeper level__.

__We’re big believers in asynchronous communication__ — write it down now and other people can absorb it later when they’re ready. Real-time communication in person or virtually forces synchronisation of schedules and is highly inefficient.

And last, __when it’s posted to Basecamp as a message, all feedback and follow up questions are automatically attached to the original post__ — This keeps all communication about the pitch centralised in one place on one page so everyone has access to the same story. One version of the truth.

Steve, Nat, and Kara are the team evaluating pitches.

## Asynchronously

People work all sorts of hours and from all sorts of places at acidlabs. This makes it hard to enforce a lot of tightly-coupled workflows during the day, but that’s a feature, not a bug. Most of the work you do shouldn’t require you to be in constant communication throughout the entire day with someone.

It’s far better for everyone’s concentration and sanity if you collaborate as though most things will get an answer eventually, but not necessarily right this second. Your first choice of action should be to post a message, a to-do, or a document about what you need to explain or need to know. Then others can read it on their schedule, when the natural lulls of the day allow it, rather than being interrupted right in their peak flow time.

Don’t take that as a hard rule, though. Sometimes you _really do_ need to collaborate with someone for an extended period of time and together in the same place, and that’s fine. Work it out and get together.

All that being said, you should still ensure that there is ample overlap with the people you work with most of the time. While most roadblocks can be cleared in 15-60 minutes, they become really annoying if it’s a one-day turn-around every time.

If it floats your boat, check the [Style Guide](https://github.com/acidlabsdesign/EmployeeHandbook/blob/master/style-guide.md) for email .sigfile addenda and choose the "work flexibly" option.

## Who does the work?

Each client project is assigned a team. So if we take on two client projects during the same period, we’d have one team working on one of the projects and another team working on the other project. Teams stay together for the full project. 
For most engagements, a team is ideally two or three people. That’s it. No teams of four, five, six. It's possibile that some new engagement may pick up the studio as a whole, but we haven't seen it yet.

We think three is the ideal size for most things — complexity begins to increase exponentially beyond that.

Exceptions happen for full-time outposted work, where you might be a solo acidlabs person on site with a client for an extended period. We'll do our best to make sure you get a day every one-to-two-weeks off-site to work with us.

Teams are assembled ad-hoc. Before a project begins, we ask each person what kind of work they’d like to do over the life of the project. Teams either coalesce around areas of interest, or we assign people to a team based on their preferences. Teams often change up after the project so everyone gets a chance to work with different people, but sometimes they stick together for a few projects. There are no hard and fast rules about this.

## Do we have dedicated project managers?

No. The lead designer on the team usually leads the project, but there’s a very close working relationship between that person and everyone else. They work together on everything.

No matter the role, everyone tracks work in the same place, communicates in the same place, etc. That's Basecamp, and definitely not in email. When everything’s in one place, everyone knows where things are, where things stand, and everyone can be self-sufficient. Splitting work and communication and management across separate tools/products is highly inefficient, and makes it very difficult for the whole team to see the whole picture.

## How long does a project last?

That's a tough one, but we're a fan of three project lengths - six weeks for small projects, 12 weeks for large projects, and for those big government or enterprise projects where the client has the appetite for it, the full 20+ weeks for the mature [GDS-style](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) Discovery-Alpha-Beta-Live project.

## Do we track time?

Not in the sense that time on deck is tied to income. We _do_ need to have an understanding of time consumed on types of work, though. We do this so that for new projects we can look back to see how to build price based on past work. And we track time internally on projects to make sure people aren't overdoing it and that the price of the project isn't exceeded by the cost of the people on it (this should never happen).

So, you'll (mostly) keep time sheets in Xero. But they don't need to be minute-accurate. 30-60 minute accuracy is enough.

We don’t measure efficiency, compare actuals vs. estimates. We have the agreed project timeline (around 20 weeks for a Discovery-Alpha-Beta-Live cycle, and different timescales for other work) to get something done. How a team decides to get it done during that time is up to them. Pricing work is based on value or days, not time or cost-plus.

What is important is that we don’t run up to the end of an engagement and figure out we’re out of time. We’re always looking at what’s done, what’s left, and how much time remains. Scope is ever-changing — adjusting down if we’re running low on time, or ramping up if we find we have more time than we thought. It’s a negotiation. It’s a very fluid process. If things do change, you _need to get the word out, fast_, via your team lead and acidlabs leadership.

## How is the actual work organised?

Each client project gets its own Basecamp project. Every task, discussion, comment, announcement, deadline, note, and chat about the project happens in this one Basecamp project.

Every design task, research task, and QA item lives on a stream of to-do lists within the project we’re working on. This way the whole team — no matter what the role — knows where things stand.

## How does QA work?

The earlier we start QA the better. QA fits into the project time frame too, so nothing busts a deadline like a pile of last minute QA findings. Check each others' work starting on Day 1. We don’t wait until the end to start QA.

## How are leadership involved?

Our leaders work with designers to explore ideas early and then help refine and simplify things as we go. They also work with designers on copywriting — making sure the words we’re using make sense. Design reviews aren’t critiques, they are problem-solving sessions.
