# Style guide

The things in this document refer equally to pitches, bids, public blogging under the acidlabs Studios banner, social media, etc. Consistency is <insert non-gender-specific royal title here>.

## The business

### Our name
The business name is __acidlabs Studios__ in all cases. The letter "a" in acidlabs is always lower case unless stupid things like Facebook prevent us from doing so.
e.g. _At acidlabs Studios, we work with you to make your business better._

### Naming projects
When naming a project, the format is __[XX-fyfynn] <some project name>__, where:
* _XX_ - an all caps two-letter code for the organisation we're working with or through. Internal projects will use __AC__ for acidlabs Studios. Where we have directly won the engagement, we'll use a code that makes it apparent who the client is. If we are loaning out someone to another studio or agency, we create a similar code for them. For example, __FX__ for FinXL and __UB__ for Unbranded Sports Preparation.
* _fyfy_ - two digits representing the financial year the project began. So, for example, a project starting in the 2017-2018 financial year will use __1718__.
* _nn_ - two digits incremented to show how many projects we've done across the entire financial year. The first project is __01__, and so on. Project numbers for an individual client won't necessarily be consecutive, as other projects will occur in between.
* _<some project name>_ - a descriptive name for the project.

### Email and your .sigfile
By preference, email is sent plain text or rich text and never HTML (unless it's an EDM).

Our .sigfile format is:

__-- 
<your name>
<email>@acidlabs.org | <mobile phone number> | @<twitter handle> | <optional personal URL such as about.me, Medium, blog, etc.>

acidlabs Studios | Better by design | www.acidlabs.org

<optional additional quote or some such>__

We don't do legal disclaimers or those kinds of things. Your optional additional quote can be anything that interests you or that you enjoy - work, personal, etc. - so long as it's professional in tone. It's okay for it to be amusing or a little irreverent; we're not the fun police.
e.g. _We work flexibly. I'm sending you this email now because it suits me, but there is no expectation you read, respond or action it outside of your regular working hours._

### Spelling and grammar
The [Macquarie Dictionary](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/) is your friend. As the official dictionary of Australian English, it generally accepts both alternatives of what are considered to be British and American English spellings. We have a few common practices:
* simpler, less flourishy, spellings are better, e.g. favorite not favourite
* we use "s" rather than "z" in things such as "ise", e.g. organise _not_ organize
* we tend not to use periods in abbreviations, e.g. USA not U.S.A., Ms not Ms.
* check it using [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) or something similar
* our preferred citation method is APA and we use [Cite This For Me](https://www.citethisforme.com/) to help us build citations and references
* failing all else, just be consistent and don't mix spelling and grammar styles

## People

### Pronouns
We refer to "we", "us" and "our team" when referring to anything we do, did, or propose to do collectively.
e.g. _We will work with you to identify and quantify the project backlog. Our team will then work in two-week sprints._

In cases where a particular staff member requires identification, we use their given or preferred name (if appropriate), and the pronoun set they have said they choose to use.
e.g. _Steve has worked as a service designer with a range of federal agencies. He is most proud of his work with DVA helping veterans._

### Nicknames and shortened names
In formal written communications including proposals and contracts:
* Stephen
* Nathanael
* Kara
In communication with existing clients and spoken form (all instances):
* Steve
* Nat
* Kara

### Credit where credit is due
In cases where an individual can be recognised for a particular skill, action, or achievement, we use their first name and the pronouns they choose to use. This applies to business development materials such as bids, as well as marketing and communication materials such as blog posts.
e.g. _Nathanael has extensive experience as an Agile Coach, and Kara is best buddies with Joe Biden._

## Language use and grammar

### In general
Accept that language is changing and mutable. English probably more than many other languages, as it is spoken and regionalised in many places. Adapt and adopt where it makes sense.
Orwell's _[Politics and the English Language](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/o/orwell/george/o79p/)_ remains relevant more than 70 years after it was written, though George would probably not be a fan of some modern, regionalised uses. His rules, however, hold true:
1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything barbarous.

In general, we are brief, to the point, no fluff, no filler, actually frank and fearless, controversial if appropriate, professional but not stale. Raise some eyebrows, but don't let them fall asleep.

### Oxford commas
Of course.

## What else?

Not sure about something? Ask. And if there's no definitive answer, the [Buzzfeed Style Guide](https://www.buzzfeed.com/emmyf/buzzfeed-style-guide) is actually very good and works for the kind of modern, no-nonsense language we want to use.
