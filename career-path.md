# Making a career at acidlabs

The average tenure of employees working at many companies today is shockingly low. At both Amazon and Google, it's [just around one year](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/career-management/tech-companies-have-highest-turnover-rate/). When you work at acidlabs, it should absolutely be feasible to think about this as the place for making a life-long career.

## Mastery and titles

Advancing your career at acidlabs doesn't mean giving up on your craft and moving into "management". Whether you work in design, operations, or whatever, you can become better at the work itself and level-up that way. This is especially important since we're a relatively small company with just two layers of managerial parfait: executives and team leads. And both the executives and leads still spend the majority of their time doing actual work themselves as well.

We're not massive fans of titles internally (though sometimes clients need a title to feel they understand something about us). That said, we've mapped our path of mastery to five different levels, shamelessly stolen from Basecamp. That title structure is shared amongst all disciplines, but the particulars of what characterizes one level from another will of course be different. Here's an example of the titles for designers (of any sort):
* Junior Designer
* Designer
* Senior Designer
* Lead Designer 
* Principal Designer

While this is how we recognise mastery, it's by no means an expectation that everyone will start as a junior and end up as a principal. We need people and perspectives from all levels of skill. And for those who do end up progressing all the way through this path, it may well be a journey of many, many years, if not a decade or more.

These titles make it clear to everyone where someone is in their career progression at acidlabs. Note that these titles are about a particular role at acidlabs. Someone may well have been a "Senior Designer" somewhere else with different assessment criteria and a different workflow, and then still start at acidlabs as a "Designer". We recognise mastery and titles at acidlabs for the work done at acidlabs.

Day to day, though, these titles aren't really much of a factor. It's not like they're printed on your HELLO MY NAME IS sticker. But they do give newcomers another way of orienting themselves at the company and it gives everyone a clear way of tracking their personal career progression at acidlabs.

## Pay and promotions

acidlabs pays at the top 20% for our industry at Canberra salary levels, regardless of where an employee lives. The comparison data is provided by a range of surveys that look at compensation data from the major companies in our industry and our smaller peers as well.

The salary data is reviewed once per year at the end of November. If it's warranted, that is if the market rates in the top 20% have gone up, we'll increase pay on January 1st to follow suit. We don't decrease pay, even if the market rates may have dropped. If that happens, we'll hold them steady until they come up again.

Everyone in the same role at the same level is paid the same at acidlabs.

When someone gets a promotion from one level to the next, they'll get a corresponding pay raise January 1st as well.

## May and November reviews

We perform bi-yearly reviews in May and November with support from external HR specialists. Everyone who has been with us at least 90 days gets a review. The primary purpose of these reviews is to give feedback on career path advancement and recognise accomplishments. We wrap up our November reviews in time to make promotion related pay adjustments effective January 1st. We follow a simple process:

* everyone writes up a 1-2 page summary and sends it to the head of their team
* the head of your team reviews your summary and prepares their own thoughts
* the head of your team will schedule a one-hour meeting to discuss your goals and progress

The head of your team will reach out to you when it's time for you to write up your review. Of course, you can (and should) ask for feedback as often as you'd like it. You should also expect it of your leads.

## And sometimes we don't stay together...
Your career is yours to make. Sometimes, you'll reach a realisation that being a part of acidlabs isn't the right thing for your life and career goals any longer. And sometimes, where we want to head as an organisation won't fit with you and your skills, ambitions, and work style any more.

Either way, we're not fans of using performance management as a way to force someone out, or not talking about the need to move on. If you're thinking about leaving, let someone in leadership know; it's possible we'll have a contact who can get you through the door at the next place that might be _perfect for you_ and we're more than happy to make the introduction. Equally, if we feel you're not right for us for some reason, we'll talk about it with you. We're not about firing people. We're about helping them find the right place for their skills and ambitions, and we're honest enough with ourselves to know that's not always going to be us.

We're not interested in keeping the decision to move on a secret. We actually think it's harmful, and would rather have an open conversation about it to see how we can make it less stressful for everyone.
