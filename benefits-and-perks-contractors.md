# Benefits and perks - Contractors, interns and casuals

Even if you're a short-term contractor, an intern, or working with us casually, we think you should be entitled to many of the same benefits as everyone else. While we're getting to know you, prior to making you a permanent offer, one of the ways we trial you working here is through a short-term contract, usually one to three months. During that time, we still treat you like a member of staff, but with fewer benefits.

## Benefits

To start with, you naturally (because it's the law) get everything the National Employment Standards entitle you to in terms of leave and conditions. Do yourself a favor and read about it at the Fair Work Ombusdman site.

### Summer hours
We work a Monday-Thursday work week during the Australian summer (or wherever your summer is if you're not in Australia). Summer hours run from November 1 to February 29. New employees may have to complete a training program with their team lead to be eligible. If you have responsibilities with a client that mean you have to work on a Friday, you are expected to take an alternate day off (usually the following Monday, or we accrue you extra leave if you're stuck on-site). Summer weeks are 4-day work weeks, so when a public holiday occurs over summer, you can take the holiday off or your normal summer day off (but not both). Any additional days off would count as rec leave days. 

This potentially looks bad for contractors, as you might work fewer days. Here's how that's not the case: show us the value of something you bring to acidlabs, whether that's skills, knowledge, or something else and we'll pay you the extra day's value each week to bring that into the company. As an alternative, you can take the day off and do something you want somewhere else, whether that's work or play.

### Sane working hours
While this isn’t a formal benefit, we encourage normal, healthy work weeks. We don’t want people working more than 37.5 hours a week in any sustained fashion. We expect that you'll work something between 32 and 36 hours each week. In a crisis, or a once-every-couple-of-years special push, we may require very short-term extended hours, but otherwise, we strongly encourage a 4-5 day week, and 8 hours of sleep a night.

## Perks

__Fitness allowance__ - acidlabs will pay up to $100/month for your gym membership, yoga studio membership, or whatever activity you do to stay in shape. If it’s not organised fitness, that’s okay, too. You can use your stipend to pay for race registrations or even new running shoes.  It doesn't accrue, so use it or lose it. Claim it as an expense.

__Massage allowance__ - Every month, you can expense up to $100 towards a massage as a part of our employee wellbeing program. Stay loose. Like fitness allowance, it doesn't accrue.

__Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) allowance__ - Fresh, organic, local fruits and vegetables are great to have on-hand so we'll pay for a local CSA membership for you. It's up to you to find a supplier, and then expense the cost up to $1000/year. If there's no CSA near you, we'll subsidise your grocery shop at an organic food store.

__Work wherever you want__ - Work from anywhere in the world. Move cities, keep your job. Of course, sometimes you'll need to get together with a client to help them with something you can't do remotely; that's how clients roll.
