# Benefits and perks

At acidlabs Studios, everyone is a member of the family. Whether you're an Australian or an overseas permanent employee we think you should be entitled to the same benefits as everyone else.

Since the majority of employees work in Australia, this section is written with that as the default. Some benefits don't make sense in other countries. We will try our best to provide comparable benefits and perks outside Australia as it makes sense, though.

## Benefits

To start with, you naturally (because it's the law) get everything the Fair Work Act entitles you to in terms of leave and conditions. Do yourself a favor and [read about it](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/) at the Fair Work Ombusdman site.

__Top 5% salaries__: We monitor industry salaries annually and make sure we’re paying in the top 5%, based on skills and experience, for every position at the company. Salaries are standardised on the Canberra market.

__4-day Summer work weeks__: We work a Monday-Thursday 8-hour day work week during the Australian summer (or wherever your summer is if you're not in Australia), for a total of 32-hour weeks. Summer hours run from November 1 to February 29. Brand new employees may have to complete a training program with their team lead to be eligible. If you have responsibilities with a client that mean you have to work on a Friday, you are expected to take an alternate day off (usually the following Monday, or we accrue you extra leave if you're stuck on-site).

And while this isn’t a formal benefit, we encourage _normal, healthy work weeks_. We don’t want people working more than 40 hours a week in any sustained fashion. We expect that you'll work something between 32 and 36 hours each week. In a crisis, or a once-every-couple-of-years special push, we may require very short-term extended hours, but otherwise, we strongly encourage a 4-day week, and 8 hours of sleep a night.

__Leave flexibility and Christmas shutdown__: we offer the required leave allowances in Australian law. We considered doing the unlimited leave thing, but it's a bit of a hassle to administer. As far as we're concerned, if you need a couple of extra days, no problem. Just discuss it with us. The period from December 24 through the first working day after 1 January is considered shutdown. You're not expected to take leave during this time, and nor are you expected to turn up to work. You still get paid.

__One-month sabbatical every three years__: Every three years, employees are eligible to take a one-month-long sabbatical. This is in addition to your long service leave entitlements under Australian law. Just give a heads-up preferably three months in advance, so we can coordinate the work-load accordingly.

__Paid parental leave__: When you welcome a new baby, acidlabs Studios encourages you to take up to 26 weeks parental leave, at 100% paid salary. All the other rules and eligibility around parental leave apply as they do under the Fair Work Act 2009.

__15% superannuation__: Just that. More than the base. You can obviously nominate your own fund of choice. If you don't have one, we will help you establish one. Our funds of choice are [Australian Ethical](https://www.australianethical.com.au/) and [Spaceship](https://www.spaceship.com.au/).

## Perks

__Fitness allowance__: acidlabs Studios will pay up to $100/month for your gym membership, yoga studio membership, or whatever activity you do to stay in shape. If it’s not organised fitness, that’s okay, too. You can use your allowance to pay for race registrations or even new running shoes.  It doesn't accrue, so use it or lose it. Claim it as an expense.

__Massage allowance__: Every month, you can expense up to $100 towards a massage as a part of our employee wellbeing program. Stay loose. Like fitness allowance, it doesn't accrue.

__Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) allowance__: Fresh, organic, local fruits and vegetables are great to have on-hand so we'll pay for a local CSA membership for you. It's up to you to find a supplier, and then expense the cost up to $1000/year. If there's no CSA near you, we'll subsidise your grocery shop at an organic food store.

__Continuing education allowance__: If you’re interested in taking classes to learn something new or further a skill, we’ll cover $1000 annually. It’s up to you; the point is to learn something that you feel enriches you as a person.

__Matching charitable gifts__: When you donate money to a qualified charity, acidlabs Studios will make a matching gift to that charity on your behalf. Divide your donations between as many recipients as you want. We'll match up to $1000/year per employee. Your charity must be registered. Donate more, and we'll certainly think you're awesome, but we'll only match the first $1000.

## Practical assistance

__Home office set-up__: Since you probably work remotely, we want to make sure your home office is comfortable. You can expense up to $1000 to furnish your home office, every three years.

__The right tools__: You may expense an appropriate laptop or desktop device, as well as an external keyboard, mouse and screen on joining acidlabs Studios, and can refresh the main device every two to three years. We don't care whether you want a Mac, a Windows machine, or some wacky homebrew Linux thing. You choose the right tools for you. At three years, a refresh is automatically approved, at two years, you need to justify the purchase.

__Coworking space allowance__: We will pay up to $100/month for you to use towards renting coworking space in your city. Please make sure you're using a true coworking space that's meant solely for working, not a club or social space.

__Expense account__: If you work in Australia, you should carry an acidlabs Studios VISA card in your name. You can use the card for any work-related expenses such as travel, software, or office supplies. If you're looking at buying software, check if we already have a license. If you need workshop supplies and such, check on stock as well. If you have any doubts about whether or not to expense something, just ask. When you do buy something with the card, get a receipt! Lodge the purchase in Xero and take a photo of that receipt and attach it. If you can’t use the VISA and have to use a personal card, add it to Xero as an expense to be repaid to you.

_We have no expense policy_. We trust you to spend money wisely. If you’re booking a flight, you don’t need to buy the cheapest, 2-layover redeye; buy the convenient, well-priced seat. If you’re attending a conference or meeting on behalf of us, we will buy your meals. Just try to stay away from lashing out like a crazy person at dinner. If you have questions about what “spend it wisely” means, just ask!
