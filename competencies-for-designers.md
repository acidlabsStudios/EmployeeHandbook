# Competencies for designers

We use the following criteria to assess the level and title of designers at acidlabs. We've adopted them from those at Basecamp with a few changes. These criteria aren't exhaustive, and they aren't merely checklists. We use the criteria as a guide for having individualised discussions about career progression.

These criteria chiefly examine the scope of work someone is capable of tackling independently on a series of projects over an extended period of time (doing something well once isn't enough to justify advancement). In addition to that assessment, we also look at the quality of the execution itself. We pay in the top 20% of the industry (based on Canberra rates), so the quality of the work itself should be commensurate with that target.
