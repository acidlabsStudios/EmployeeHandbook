# Where (and when) we work

## Office

The acidlabs HQ is in Canberra, in the city. We used to rent desks at [Entry 29](http://entry29.org.au/) but its situation changed in 2019; we're waiting to see what happens next to decide if we need space again. Most of the time, our people are on site with clients.

## From home

Most people at acidlabs work from home part of the time. You can spend up to $1,000 every three years outfitting your home office. Getting the basics right will make a big difference: a good chair and a good desk.

## From coffee shops

Working from home all the time isn't everyone's cup of coffee. Sometimes choose to work from coffee shops or other third spaces. Great for a buzz of other people and much-needed caffeine of course, but please do think about basic security rules and procedures to ensure that nothing leaks on to the cafe wifi (essentially, use a VPN at the very least, lock your screen, and maybe use a polarising shield).

## From a coworking space somewhere else

If working for home or from a coffee shop doesn't suit you and you're not in Canberra, then trying a coworking space might just do the trick. We offer $100/month towards a desk in such a place.

## Working hours

Your working hours are mostly up to you. Just be a responsible adult.

If you are on a project with a client team, you need to negotiate your hours with them, but will probably need to work normal office hours.

## Studio Fridays

No matter where you're working, we try to spend at least every second Friday together so that we can share ideas, get face-to-face peer review on our project work, bounce ideas off each other, and so on.
