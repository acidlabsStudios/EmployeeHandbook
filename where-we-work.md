# Where (and when) we work

## Office

The acidlabs HQ is in Canberra, in the city. We rent desks at [Entry 29](http://entry29.org.au/), our favorite coworking space. Right now, one person (Steve) uses desk space there, but he also works on client site or from home regularly. 

Anyone is welcome to visit Canberra and work from E29 at any time; we'll cover the cost of your visit.

## From home

Most people at acidlabs work from home a significant part of the time. You can spend up to $1,000 every three years outfitting your home office. Getting the basics right will make a big difference: a good chair and a good desk.
If you're looking for a recommendation, IKEA's [BEKANT](http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/categories/departments/workspaces/18960/) desk with the auto riser is perfect, and the matching GALANT drawers and office furniture go nicely. Herman Miller's Aeron is obviously the go-to chair, but it's expensive. There are other options that do well, but you'll need to shop around and test.

## From coffee shops

Working from home all the time isn't everyone's cup of coffee. Sometimes choose to work from coffee shops or other third spaces. Great for a buzz of other people and much-needed caffeine of course, but please do think about basic security rules and procedures to ensure that nothing leaks on to the cafe wifi.

## From a coworking space somewhere else

If working for home or from a coffee shop doesn't suit you and you're not in Canberra, then trying a coworking space might just do the trick. We offer $100/month towards a desk in such a place.

## Working hours

Your working hours are up to you. Want to work a regular 9-5? Keen. Got kids and need to be there for them before and after school? Work around that need. Night owl? Work after dark. Whatever.

The only caveats to this are if you are on a project with a team in-studio and they need you, you need to be available for a crossover of 2-4 hours as agreed with your team and if you're on-site with a client, you need to negotiate your hours with them, but will probably need to work normal office hours.

## Studio Fridays

No matter where you're working, we try to spend at least every second Friday together so that we can share ideas, get face-to-face peer review on our project work, bounce ideas off each other, and so on. We do this at Entry 29, with calls in from remote team members if they want to be involved.

## Kara's Office Hours

Once a month, we have a call on Zoom where everyone gets together to discuss our questions, strategies, the design industry, and some less meaningful things. It's a chance for Kara to offer her experience and mentorship, as well as being really good for team building.
