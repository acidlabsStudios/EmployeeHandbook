# What we stand for
## Values
Before anything else, values come first. Without clear, shared values, we wander independently and contradict one another. We have a Manifesto - you should take a look. Everything's harder when we all believe different things about what's important to us.

__Honesty.__ Err on the side of openness. Always. There’s no such thing as too honest. Whenever we speak - internally or externally - we should speak plainly and clearly. Watch out for jargon, assumptions, exaggeration, or other things that get in the way of a straightforward explanation. This doesn't mean we erase expression from our language, but it's got to make sense. With the exception of deep technical discussions, anyone who reads what we collectively write should simply get it without further explanation required.

__Trust.__ Believe the best in people, until they prove to you otherwise. Take the trust that others place in you to heart. Trust each other to be good and fair, and trust our clients to be the same. Behave the way you expect others to, and make good things happen. A good rule of thumb is "what would you do for a friend or a neighbor if they asked for help?"

__Simplicity.__ The essentials are all you need. Focus is a limited resource. A good litmus test is “What would happen if I didn’t do this?”. This pretty much goes alongside honesty and trust. Nobody here is expected to do more than is needed, but we are all expected to do the best we can, not the minimum.

__Passion.__ Connect with what gives you meaning. Have a burning desire to help others feel the same way. On fire is the only way to be. As we said above, do your best. Your best work. Your best advice. Your best effort on a problem. But never alone - ask for the help you need so you don't have to do less than your best.

## To help people design smarter, more efficient and effective, happier organisations
That's what we're here to do.

The organisations we work with are better at what they do because we helped them design it that way - and they’re happier and more effective because of our work. It's our job to help them unpick the puzzle they've become lost by, and help them reassemble it in such a way as all the pieces are there and it's beautiful.

Most organisations band-aid together a bunch of tools, processes, and ways of doing and presenting things as they grow. Over time, this turns into a potentially nasty hairball of confusion and it eventually catches up to them. The way they did things and understood their worlds stops working.

This is where acidlabs comes in.

We help organisations better understand their people, their customers and clients, their business, and their products and services so they can do what they do better.
## The way we do things around here

We have a few basic rules you should be aware of:

__Our most important rule is *you are the boss of your own shit*__ - this means that you should be self-starting and look for things that need doing and offer to do them. If there's something that you think needs to be done that isn't a part of your current project, talk to one of your teammates about it and then pitch it in the HQ Message Board. Don't worry if it's not officially your job - we are trying very hard to work without silos.  

__We have a firm *no assholes rule*__ - let's all stick by it. You can [read the book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97905.The_No_Asshole_Rule). 

__We *communicate openly and with honesty*__ - raise problems and questions early and often. If you feel like you need to call something out that's bugging you, ask a question or get help with anything, just ask. There are no stupid questions.

__*Everything goes on Basecamp* except personal matters__ - please don’t use email for any internal communication. Everything we do can happen on or be linked to Basecamp. There's nothing that's hidden at acidlabs, though you may not be actively circulated on everything. If you want to see something, ask. You should trust all your colleagues will share information with you fully and often.

__*Your time is your own* to manage__ - if you're full time, we expect 32-38 hours a week of your best work from you, and that you go home on time. Part-timers, contractors, and casuals obviously have different hours. Your time is not ours to take away and fill with pointless meetings. You'll meet face-to-face with other team members and clients only as needed and you'll certainly need to be present during those times - probably around two hours each day. But those things should be fairly rare. We don't mind when you do your work, so long as the outcome gets done. We need you to have time to think and do your work and live a balanced life, not attend meetings that could be handled another way! We should only request face-to-face meetings of each other when Basecamp can't handle what you want to do.

__We're about *outcomes not face time*__ - on top of the rule above, if you get your work done in 20 hours not 32, good on you. Use the extra time you have to help out somewhere else with another project, invent something of use to the company, or check with your team lead and maybe grab an extra personal day for yourself.

If there's not a rule written down for something, you should assume the expectation is to think and act like a reasonable person. If there's not a rule written down for something, and you think it should be, bring it up in a message thread in HQ and we'll thrash it out.
